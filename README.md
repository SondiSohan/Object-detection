Welcome to my Object Detection Project Repository!

This project focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques for object detection in images and videos. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in this repository:

Data Collection and Annotation: The project includes tools and scripts for collecting diverse datasets containing annotated objects. The annotation process ensures accurate labeling with bounding boxes and class labels.
Preprocessing Pipeline: I've implemented a robust preprocessing pipeline that handles tasks like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. These steps are crucial for enhancing model generalization and performance.
Model Selection and Training: Explore state-of-the-art object detection models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO, SSD, and RetinaNet. The repository contains training scripts and configurations for fine-tuning these models on custom datasets.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate model performance using industry-standard metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). Detailed evaluation scripts are provided to assess object detection accuracy.
Deployment and Integration: Learn about deploying object detection models in real-world applications. Discover strategies for integrating models into software systems, developing APIs for inference, and deploying on edge devices for real-time detection.
Applications and Use Cases: Explore diverse application areas for object detection, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, retail analytics, medical imaging, and agricultural monitoring. Gain insights into how object detection drives innovation across industries.
Continuous Improvement and Collaboration: This repository is a work in progress, with ongoing efforts to improve model accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. I welcome collaboration and contributions from the community to enhance object detection capabilities further.
